Every mobile game available on iOS has an online profile listing features of the app, such as price, age rating, and review score distribution. These features were scraped and prepared to fit a regression model that aims to predict the popularity of a given game. Knowing the most important features that are correlated with game popularity will inform the business strategy of Game Revenant.

In addition to the previous work, this project created a new model and improved a prediciton of number of rating by analyzing descriptions of each game using NLP and nltk.
